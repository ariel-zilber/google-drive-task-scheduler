# google-drive-task-scheduler

A lightweight, file-based task scheduler designed to run on **Google Colab** using **Google Drive** as a shared backend. It enables distributed and concurrent task execution across multiple notebook instances by tracking task state via file extensions (`.todo.yaml`, `.running.yaml`, `.done.yaml`).

## Features

- ðŸ§  Simple file-based design â€” no need for databases or message queues.
- ðŸ“‚ Shared-state coordination using Google Drive.
- ðŸš€ Safe for concurrent execution across multiple Colab tabs or users.
- ðŸ“Š Supports custom task formats (YAML/JSON).
- ðŸ”„ Easily extendable with retries, priorities, or heartbeats.

## Use Case

Ideal for:
- Parameter sweeps and ML experiments
- Parallel data processing tasks
- Lightweight meta-agent task routing
- Educational/distributed execution on free compute (e.g. Colab)
